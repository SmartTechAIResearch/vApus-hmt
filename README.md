vApus hardware monitor tool for Windows and Linux is able to read CPU specific counters (C states, P states, ...) for modern (starting from Nehalem) Intel CPUs.

AMD is supported from Magny-Cours, but not all counters are available due to lacking information in the BKDGs.

Voltages, temperatures and DRAM frequencies are also monitored.

Extends from the vApus-agent Netbeans packages and vApus-vApus-agent communication protocol compliant. See the vApus-agent readme.
